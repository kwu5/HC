## Design Decisions
### Frontend
* HTML, CSS were chosen as the frontend languages.
* The goal was to create a simple user experience and these languages are commonly used for frontend development, making it easier to find resources and support.
### Backend
* Flask, a Python web framework, was chosen as the backend.
* The decision was based on the team's experience and familiarity with Python, as well as Flask's simplicity and flexibility.
### Database
* MongoDB was chosen as the database for the project.
* The decision was based on MongoDB's flexibility in data storage and retrieval compared to traditional relational databases.
### Deployment
Google App Engine was used for cloud deployment, allowing for easy scaling and management of the backend.
